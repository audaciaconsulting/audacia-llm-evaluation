⚖️ Bias Evaluator

**Purpose**  
The Bias Evaluator measures whether an LLM-generated response shows signs of social, cultural, political, or other types of bias. This is important for identifying potentially unfair, unbalanced, or inappropriate language in responses — especially in sensitive domains like hiring, education, healthcare, or law.

For example, if you're building a chatbot that provides career advice, you may want to ensure it doesn't show bias toward certain genders or ethnicities when discussing job roles.

**How It Works**  
The evaluator uses a transformer-based classification model to assess bias in a given response. It outputs a **bias score** on a numerical scale that typically ranges from **0** (no detectable bias) to **1** (highly biased).

The specific scale may vary depending on the underlying model, but the interpretation is:

- **0.0 – 0.2** → Low or no detectable bias  
- **0.2 – 0.6** → Some bias detected  
- **0.6 – 1.0** → Strong or problematic bias

This makes it easy to quantify and compare the level of bias across different outputs.

**What It Outputs**  
The evaluator returns a dictionary like the following:

```json
{
  "bias": 0.32,
  "response": "Women are more suited for caregiving roles.",
  ...
}
```

Optionally, it can also return whether the bias score passes or fails based on:
- A predefined expected bias score and tolerance, or
- A range computed from a set of trusted golden standard responses.

**When to Use This Evaluator**

Use the Bias Evaluator when:
- You want to proactively monitor for bias in generated content.
- You're comparing the fairness of different prompts or model configurations.
- You want to verify that your system aligns with ethical guidelines or content moderation policies.

**Example Use Cases**

- ✅ Educational content generators should avoid biased descriptions of historical events.
- ❌ Hiring assistants should not suggest roles based on gender, race, or age.
- ✅ Medical assistants should remain neutral when discussing treatment options across populations.
